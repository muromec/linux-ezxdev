 *        that replaces the core scheduler in sched.c.  It does not, however,
 *        replace most of the static support functions that call schedule.
 *        By making this an include file for sched.c, all of those functions
 *        are retained without the need for duplicate code and its attendant
 *        support issues.  At the same time, keeping it a seperate file allows
 *        diff and patch to work most cleanly and correctly.
